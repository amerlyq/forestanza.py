The development of the original *forestanza* python prototype have been
ceased in the favor of the [cross-platform Qt-based solution in C++](https://github.com/amerlyq/forestanza).

# forestanza
Translation assistance toolset to adapt foreign texts for reading (negligible language proficiency).

## Distribution
Many narrow-purpose tools + main control panel

## Motivation
  * In fact I'm spending time by writing utils and providing them to TLs.
  * But it spares time when reading theirs TLs instead of TLing myself.
  * Regretfully, efforts will be repaid only when many TLs involved
    (if all TLs in sum produces more in eng, than I can read in jap myself).
  * However, community wins anyway.
  * Bonus: I also get enhanced tools to fasten my raw reading.

### Faster reading speed for WN
  * Assistance in learning Japanese.
  * Enhance sentence comprehension speed.

### Tools for TL
  * Goal: reduce mental fatigue.
  * Eliminate the most frustrating/irritating/monotonous tasks.
    * Develop niche scripts (if needed).
    * Glue together existing tools (if possible).

At the end, I can't hope for something more then interactive helper,
similar to binary code disassemblers. After all, natural language
processing is much more difficult then deterministic machine language.
